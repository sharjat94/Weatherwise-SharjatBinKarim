Me: How can I fetch weather data for Perth for the next 5 days?
AI: You can use the wttr.in API. Example: `https://wttr.in/Perth?format=j1`. Then parse the JSON to get daily forecasts.

Me: How do I get the max temperature from the JSON?
AI: Use `data["weather"][0]["maxtempC"]` for the first day. Loop over `data["weather"]` for all days.

Me: And what about rain data?
AI: Each day has an `hourly` list. Sum `precipMM` values for the day to get total precipitation.

Me: I want to plot temperature trends for Fremantle. How?
AI: Use matplotlib. Plot max and min temperatures over the forecast dates. Use markers for clarity.

Me: Should I fill between min and max temps?
AI: Yes! `plt.fill_between(dates, min_temps, max_temps, color='lightgray', alpha=0.5)` makes it visually easier to interpret.

Me: Can I combine rain and temperature in one graph?
AI: Yes, use a twin y-axis. Plot temperature on ax1 and precipitation as bars on ax2.

Me: How can I make my weather advisor respond to questions like "Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?"
AI: Implement a simple NLP parser. Check for keywords like "rain", "tomorrow", and extract location from the text.

Me: What if the location isn’t mentioned?
AI: You can default to a main location, e.g., "Perth", or ask the user to input a location.

Me: Can I also detect "temperature" or "wind"?
AI: Yes, search for keywords ["temperature", "hot", "cold"] for temperature, and ["wind", "breeze"] for wind.
